I'm a Sydney-based full-stack developer who loves to create.

I am inspired by the intersection of logic and creativity which underpins software engineering. I enjoy working with like-minded people in a collaborative environment, making incremental advancements to effect scaled change. My goal is to empower individuals and local business through human-centred development.

When I'm not coding, I'm either away on a camping trip or curled up on the couch with a glass of red and a good book. You may also find me trying to figure out social media or at my barre studio remembering how to exercise.
